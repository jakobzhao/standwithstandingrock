# Stand with #Standing Rock

The Dakota Access Pipeline Protest (#NoDAPL) began in early 2016 in reaction to the approved construction of Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.

Local native American and environmentalists were gathered at both Standing Rock and #Standing Rock on Facebook to express their deep concerns.

Due to the fierce local conflict triggered by the proposed pipeline, environmental protestors were forced to leave their camping area at the Standing Rock. Today, it has become nearly impssible for people to access the former camping area. Even though, an increasing number of social media users still stand with #StandingRock via spoofing their check-ins on Facebook.
